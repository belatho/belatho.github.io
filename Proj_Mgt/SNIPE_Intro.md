# An introduction to the SNIPE project analysis framework

## Some context 

- First of all, a project is meant to solve a problem. (Improving a situation is solving a problem = "How can I improve this situation?"). This means we will always have to perform some level of problem analysis.
- As the saying goes : "If you have a problem, SNIPE it!" ;)
- There are lots of frameworks, ranging from super light, but not really helpful, to extremely detailed, bringing structure in complex coordination of efforts, but also adding an excessive amount of administrative work. The purpose of this document is to stay as light as possible, but providing tools that will help to swiftly address some of the burdensome project management activities.

## The SNIPE framework

### S for Situation

This is where you describe the situation in which you are. This means in particular to provide insights on the context in which you operate, and a description of the problem that needs to be tackled.

### N for Needs

Here you will document what is required in order to get the problem solved. The needs are twofolds : on one hand, it's the set of outcomes / deliverables that are absolutley needed for the resolution of the problem. On the other side, it can be the resources or conditions that will have to be available so that the work can be done and the resolution achieved.

### I for Intent

This is a short paragraph that summarizes what you intend to do in order to solve the problem. It could be seen as a mission statement.   
For example, an intent could be "In order to be in this future situation, I intend to develop this specific capability inside my organisation".

### P for Planning

The main milestone will be described in this part. It documents the timeline and articulation of actions through time.

### E for Execution

This is where roles should be documented : who is doing what, and who is responsible for what.
